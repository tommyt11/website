<h1 style="color:maroon;"> My Experiences with Fishing </h1>
<p style="color:maroon;"> Another one of my hobbies is fishing. I have been fishing since I was very young. My dad taught me how to fish, the same way his dad taught him, and so on and so forth. I would go to the pond with him and just 
watch him cast and reel and every once in a while he would let me hold the rod or reel in the fish. When I got a little older it became more involved and I even had my owen rod. As the years went on I got better and became 
more interested in fishing.  </p>
<br>
<p style="color:maroon;"> I first learned how to fish the normal way. When I was ten years old, my dad started teaching me how to fly fish. Fly fishing is a different type of fishing where you wade into the water and cast a lightweight 
fly instead of a lure. Instead of reeling in the line, you pull on it. It takes a lot more skill and rythm to do this. It took me a long time to get the hang of, but I am pretty good at it now.  </p>

 <br>
<p style="color:maroon;"> I don't neccesarily prefer one over the other. I think I find myself fly fishing more than I am fishing regularly. There is something about the simplicity and rythm of fly fishing that is much more appealing to me. 
I have also tried deep sea fishing a few times, but I do not find it as fun or engaging as other types of fishing. I try to fish once a week at least in the summer, sometimes closer to once a day.  </p>
