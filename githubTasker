<h1> A Website about Tommy Tasker </h1>
<p> Hello! My name is Tommy Tasker. I am a 20 year old college student. One of the classes I am enrolled in this semester is called Digital Literacy. In this class
I learn to be more technologically savvy. One element of that is learning how to code and create websites using HTML. I have some experience with this. In high school 
I took a class called Web Page Design in which I worked with HTML. I also took AP Computer Science, so I have some experience with a few other languages. Although I have used these 
languages in the past, it is still a little challenging and I am quite rusty, so this is my attempt at creating a website for myself. </p>
<br>
<p> I have learned how to do many new things with computers, and specifically with HTML. I am now able to create a running website that has images, YouTube videos, different fonts and colors, and even navigation bars. 
I know my code is pretty elementary, and I still have to look plenty of things up, but I am proud of how much I remember how to do. This is my first time using GitHub. </p>
<br>
<p> This website consists of three pages, each providing general insight about who I am, or things I am interested in. You can navigate through the pages using the navigation bar at the top of the page. I hope you 
find this website to be helpful and informative, and I hope you learn something about me along the way. </p>
<br>
<b> Enjoy! </b>
