<h1> My Favorite Hobby: Hockey</h1>
<p> My favorite thing to do is watch or play sports. My whole life my favorite sport to both watch and play has been ice hockey. I started playing hockey when I was two and a half years old 
and I continue to play still today. I do not play competitively anymore, but I still enjoy playing casually and watching it as well. </p>
<br>
<p> I often watch college hockey. My favorite team is Notre Dame. I have been a Notre Dame fan my whole life and watch their football and hockey games all the time. 
I really enjoy watching college hockey, but I much prefer watching the National Hockey League, or NHL for short. The NHL was founded in 1917 and consists of 32 teams. 
My favorite NHL team is the Boston Bruins. </p>

<p> The Bruins were one of the Original Six teams that existed in 1917 when the league was founded. Being an Original Six team means there is lots of tradition and a history of successful teams and 
passionate fans. The last time the Bruins won the Stanley Cup was in 2011, and I went to the championship parade in Boston to celebrate. The Bruins are currently in first place in the NHL, but it is 
very early in the season. Hopefully they keep up the solid play and are able to win a Stanley Cup this year. </p>
